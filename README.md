# Real-Time Chat Application

## Introduction
This project is a full-stack real-time chat application that allows users to communicate in real-time through private or group chat rooms. The application is built using modern web technologies such as React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Socket.io, providing a seamless, responsive, and scalable user experience. Users can send messages instantly, view message history, and see real-time updates when others are typing or when new messages arrive.

## Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages instantly with no delay using Socket.io.
- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication via JWT, allowing users to sign up, log in, and access chat rooms.
- **Chat Rooms**: Users can join existing chat rooms or create new ones to chat privately or with groups.
- **Typing Indicators**: Real-time notifications when another user is typing.
- **Message Persistence**: Chat messages are stored in MongoDB for easy retrieval of chat history.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS (or Bootstrap/Tailwind for styling), Axios for API calls, Socket.io client for real-time communication.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js for API endpoints and handling requests, Socket.io for WebSocket connections, JWT for authentication.
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ORM for storing user data, messages, and chat rooms.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.io for handling real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.

## Architecture
1. **Client-Side (React.js)**:
   - React.js components handle the user interface, routing, and manage the state of the application.
   - Axios is used to send HTTP requests to the backend for user authentication and message retrieval.
   - Socket.io is used on the client-side for real-time messaging.
   
2. **Server-Side (Node.js + Express.js)**:
   - Express.js handles API requests, user authentication, and message routing.
   - The Socket.io server listens for real-time events such as sending and receiving messages.
   
3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - MongoDB stores chat messages, user details, and chat room information.
   - Mongoose is used for defining schemas and interacting with the database.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB (running locally or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsaman080/Real-Time-Chat-Application.git
   cd chat-app-react-nodejs
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. In a separate terminal, run the React client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to open the application.
2. Sign up or log in to create/join chat rooms and start messaging.
3. Real-time messages, typing indicators, and chat history are all functional upon login.

## Future Improvements
- **File Sharing**: Add functionality for users to share files within the chat.
- **Notifications**: Implement push notifications to alert users of new messages.
- **Message Reactions**: Allow users to react to messages with emojis or likes.
- **Video/Voice Chat**: Extend the application to support voice and video communication.
